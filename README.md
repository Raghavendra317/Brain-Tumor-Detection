## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset consists of MRI brain scans categorized into two classes: **Tumor** and **Non-Tumor**.  
- Preprocessing techniques applied:  
  - Image resizing to 150x150 pixels  
  - Normalization (pixel values scaled between 0 and 1)  
  - Augmentation (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments)  
- The dataset was split into **80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test sets**.
